#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering involves the application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software systems
Software engineering has enabled the creation of various software applications and systems that aid in various aspects of our daily lives

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C).
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970. 
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: This involves creating high level design of the software frame work and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Testing involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. This can involve getting random people to navigate through the software and give their feedback
Deployment: this is the release of the software to users or customers (final consumers)
Maintenance: This involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is sequential while the agile methodology is incremental and iterative.
The waterfall methodology is used in traditional teams where there is a team lead (project manager) while the Agile methodology is used in self-organizing teams

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:They are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions for the creation of high-quality and user friendly software
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. They ensure that deaedlines are met and high quality and user friendly softwares are produced.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. E.g. Visual Studio
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. E.g.Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering deals with developing your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant
Prompt Engineering enables the user to be able to craft clear and concise input to enable Ai or robot to give specific output

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: I want a food picture
Improved prompt:I want a picture of rice.
The vague prompt was not specific about the type of food and as a result, AI can generate any food picture
